Performed exploratory data analysis on 8,800+ Netflix titles using Python to identify content trends and user preferences.

Analyzed content types, ratings, release years, and geographical distribution to derive business insights.

Found that Movies dominate the platform and that TV-MA and TV-14 are the most common ratings, targeting mature and teen audiences.

Identified that most content is from recent years (2017â€“2019) and mainly from the US, India, and the UK.

Detected missing values, assessed outliers, and visualized distributions using histograms, pie charts, countplots, and boxplots.

Recommended strategies for content diversification, regional customization, and increasing older/classic TV show availability.
